# GitHub contribution automation

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

- Keep contributor-facing prompts in `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, policy logic in
  tested modules under `scripts/`, path ownership in `labeler.yml`, and GitHub
  event orchestration in `workflows/`. Do not duplicate the same rule across
  those layers.
- Changes to required PR template headings must update the checker in the same
  commit and validate representative complete and rejected bodies locally.
- Every external PR links a full Lody issue URL and retains the complete Context
  handoff block and its markers. Each Authoring context field is a concise public
  summary; `N/A` and redacted values are not accepted because maintainers need
  enough provenance, scope, and risk information to assess the contribution.
- An authoring Agent does not treat creating an Issue as approval. It tells its
  author-side user about the policy and waits for explicit maintainer agreement
  on scope and approach before implementation or an external PR. It also warns
  that Context handoff is public, invalid bodies close after seven days, and
  oversized PRs without an Issue URL get the same grace period. Never invent
  notice or agreement that did not happen.
- Review instructions are a PR-specific handoff to the organization owners'
  reviewing Agent. Require concise review focus, decisions to challenge, and
  plausible failures or evidence gaps; fixed generic reviewer boilerplate and
  long review essays are not valid substitutes.
- `labeler.yml` is the source of truth for path-based `scope:*` labels. Overlap
  is intentional when a pull request affects multiple product areas.
- Issue forms cover only components present in the public repository. Keep Bug
  and Feature title prefixes, issue types, and existing labels aligned; route
  product support and security reports out of public issues, and request only
  diagnostics that contributors have checked and redacted.
- `scripts/check-issue-body.mjs` mirrors the required rendered headings and
  confirmations in both Issue Forms. Non-owner, non-bot issues that bypass or
  remove them receive the warning-only `status:needs-issue-body` state; regular
  organization members are not exempt. A valid edit clears the bot-owned state.
- External pull request body enforcement is based on the PR author's
  `author_association`. Only `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, and automated bot accounts are
  exempt by default; outside collaborators and prior contributors remain subject
  to it. Repository owners may explicitly exempt an exceptional PR with
  `status:pr-policy-bypass`; adding or removing it immediately reconciles both
  body and size policy state.
- `workflows/pr-policy.yml` is the only event entry point for external PR body,
  size, and expiry policy. The three implementation workflows remain callable
  only through `workflow_call`; route new events through the entry point so one
  run owns concurrency and dispatch.
- Workflows triggered by `pull_request_target` have a write-capable token. For
  PR events, read policy scripts and configuration from the trusted revision at
  `github.sha`; scheduled and manual audits use
  `github.event.repository.default_branch`. Never check out or execute the PR
  head, and never use the possibly stale `github.event.pull_request.base.sha`.
- Code CI runs on `pull_request` with read-only repository permissions, checks
  out all public submodules recursively, and keeps the stable `Static checks`
  and `Tests` jobs aligned with the root validation scripts so they can be used
  as required status checks.
- `scripts/pr-body-policy.mjs` owns PR-body status labels, comment markers, and
  the shared external-PR exemption, and the seven-day grace period. An invalid
  external PR keeps its original timer across edits and pushes; only a valid body
  or explicit exemption clears the state. Before closing, the scheduled workflow
  must re-read and revalidate the latest body.
- External PR size enforcement counts additions plus deletions. A change over
  200 lines without a full Lody issue URL is labeled `status:pr-too-large` and
  shares the PR-body seven-day correction window; adding a valid URL clears the
  warning, while body expiry performs the eventual closure. Automation does not
  infer maintainer agreement.
- PR-body comments require pull-request write permission. Immediate comment and
  label updates are best-effort feedback; the checker result alone decides the
  event-driven enforcement job. Expired PRs keep `status:pr-body-expired` and
  are closed again when reopened, so a contributor must submit a new PR.
