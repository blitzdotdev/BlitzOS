/**
 * SSE-first live transport policy with a bounded long-poll fallback.
 *
 * Machine RPC responses are an always-on live read. Long-poll pays a GET plus a
 * CORS preflight per cycle (the `cursor`/`offset` change every poll, so the
 * preflight cache cannot collapse them), which a healthy SSE connection avoids
 * entirely. But `@loro-dev/streams-client` `auto` mode only downgrades to
 * long-poll on an explicit 400 "SSE unsupported" response: an SSE connection
 * that fails after startup — or that connects and then silently stops
 * delivering — ends the live iterator with an error instead of falling back,
 * which strands every pending RPC call.
 *
 * This policy sits above the streams client and owns that decision:
 *
 * - Start on SSE (requested as `auto`, so a server that rejects SSE outright is
 *   downgraded inside the same read with no gap).
 * - Fall back to long-poll when SSE is unsupported, when consecutive SSE reads
 *   fail, or when pending RPC responses keep timing out while SSE looks healthy
 *   (the silent-loss case that has no transport-level signal).
 * - Re-probe SSE after a cooldown, except when the server said it does not
 *   support SSE at all.
 *
 * One instance tracks one live stream. Offsets/cursors live in the caller's
 * `LoroJsonStreamState` and are untouched by transport switches.
