/**
 * Resolve an avatar URL to a locally-cached blob URL, cache-first, and swap to
 * a fresh copy only when the remote actually changed.
 *
 * This is the "stable" counterpart to `useCachedAvatarSrc`
 * (cached-avatar-img.tsx). Use it for our own long-lived avatars (user image /
 * workspace logo on R2), where the raw `src` URL is itself the current remote:
 *
 *   - Local blob hot (memory hit, e.g. rehydrated at startup): paint it
 *     immediately (instant, offline-safe), then revalidate the remote in the
 *     background and swap only if the bytes changed. No flicker on unchanged.
 *   - No hot blob yet: paint the raw URL now — it IS the current remote, served
 *     from the browser HTTP cache — and fill the blob cache in the background
 *     WITHOUT swapping. The bytes are identical, so a raw→blob swap would only
 *     cause a re-decode flicker; the blob is used on the next mount.
 *
 * `useCachedAvatarSrc` deliberately DOES swap raw→blob on first load — it is
 * tuned for GitHub owner avatars whose short `max-age` makes the raw URL an
 * unreliable paint, so the blob is the first dependable one. Don't conflate.
