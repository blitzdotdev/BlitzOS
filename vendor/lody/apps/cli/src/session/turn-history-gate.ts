/**
 * TurnHistoryGate — ordering barrier for RPC fast-path turn output.
 *
 * ## Problem
 *
 * `session/dispatch-turn` (the chat fast path) pushes the full turn payload over
 * Machine RPC so the CLI can start the agent before the session-doc history CRDT
 * syncs. The user's history entry is written by the web client into ITS replica;
 * the CLI never writes that entry itself. If the CLI persists turn output (the
 * assistant entry and streamed ACP content) while the user entry has not synced
 * here yet, the two list insertions are CONCURRENT at the same anchor, and the
 * Loro merge tiebreak can permanently order the agent's reply BEFORE the user's
 * message on every device.
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * - Agent execution starts immediately (the fast path's latency win is kept).
 * - Turn-scoped history LIST writes (assistant entry creation, ACP update
 *   flushes, finalization, failure notices) wait until the user turn entry is
 *   visible in the CLI-local history doc, so they are causally ordered after it.
 * - The wait is bounded: after `timeoutMs` the gate opens anyway (degrades to
 *   the pre-gate behavior — possible misorder — instead of holding output
 *   hostage to a broken uplink). A timeout implies the web→CLI doc sync is
 *   stalled, in which case that client cannot see our output either way.
 * - Metadata/status writes are NOT gated: they are map-keyed (no list-order
 *   race) and some sit on the prompt-start critical path.
 *
 * Turns whose payload arrived via the history CRDT or the message queue never
 * need a gate — their user entry is already local by construction.
