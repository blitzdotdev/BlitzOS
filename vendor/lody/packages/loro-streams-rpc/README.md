# `@lody/loro-streams-rpc`

Machine RPC transport over Loro Streams, built on the JSON-stream adapter from
`@loro-dev/streams-client`.

The package owns:

- Machine RPC request/response stream naming. Requests use
  `<workspaceId>:rpc:req:<machineId>`. New web runtimes share a
  `<workspaceId>:rpc:res:<uuid>` response stream; the legacy
  `<workspaceId>:rpc:res:<machineId>:<uuid>` form remains supported.
- RPC envelope schemas and validation.
- The JSON stream client.
- The web RPC client.
- The CLI RPC server.

## Development

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:watch
```

## Integration tests

The default `pnpm test` command does not start a local Loro Streams development
server. Run the real request/response round trip with:

```bash
pnpm test:integration
```

The integration command starts a local server through `loro dev --db-path ...` and
then runs the transport tests against it.
