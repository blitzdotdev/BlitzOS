# Standalone single-file viewer (`lody review`)

The standalone build produces ONE self-contained HTML file that renders a review
over `file://` with no server. It backs `lody review <file>.review.md` (CLI) and
`review-helper export --format html`.

## Pipeline (`pnpm build:standalone`)

1. `vite build --config vite.standalone.config.ts` bundles `standalone.html` +
   `src/standalone/main.tsx` and inlines all JS/CSS into one HTML via
   `vite-plugin-singlefile` → `dist-standalone/standalone.html` (no review data; it
   has a `<!--LODY_REVIEW_DATA-->` placeholder in `<head>`).
2. `scripts/embed-standalone.mjs` reads `prompts/review-helper-agent.md` and writes
   the plain-string TS module `dist-standalone/embedded-prompt.ts` (`reviewPrompt`).

`dist-standalone/` is gitignored and regenerated. The `build` script runs
`build:standalone`, so `pnpm -r build` (topological) builds it before dependents.

## How the viewer reaches the CLI

The ~8 MB `standalone.html` is NOT bundled into `lody`. The sibling package
`lody-code-review-viewer` copies it verbatim and publishes it publicly; `lody review`
downloads it from jsDelivr at the pinned version, sha256-verifies, and caches it (see
`packages/code-review-viewer` + the CLI's `src/lib/review-viewer.ts`). Only the small
agent prompt is embedded in the CLI.

## Why a string module for the prompt (not `?raw`)

The `lody` CLI uses an esbuild bundle in development and a Vite SSR bundle in
production. Neither resolves Vite's `?raw` here, and published `lody` ships only
`dist/` (no access to this package's data files). A plain TS string module imports
cleanly in both; the CLI lazy-imports `@lody/code-review-helper/prompt-text` inside the
command action.

## Shiki size control (the crux)

`@pierre/diffs` loads grammars via `bundledLanguages[lang]()`, and shiki's real
`bundledLanguages` maps ALL 383 grammars (each a `() => import()`), which singlefile
would inline (~12 MB). `vite.standalone.config.ts` has a `resolveId` plugin that
redirects shiki's `dist/langs.mjs` → `src/standalone/curated-shiki-langs.ts` (a
curated ~40-lang map, identical `() => import('@shikijs/langs/<id>')` loaders, plus a
Proxy that returns an empty plaintext grammar for non-curated langs so nothing throws)
and `dist/themes.mjs` → `src/standalone/curated-shiki-themes.ts` (empty: the viewer
registers its own Vesper-derived theme, never a bundled-by-name theme). Result ≈ 8.5 MB
single file. To highlight more languages, add canonical ids (+ their real aliases) to
`curated-shiki-langs.ts`; behavior for a curated id is identical to the full build.

`injectReviewSnapshot` (`src/standalone/inject.ts`) splices the snapshot into the
template ahead of the module script (JSON `<`-escaped so review text can't break out).
`src/standalone/main.tsx` reads `window.__LODY_REVIEW__` and renders `ReviewRenderer`
inside `CodeReviewThemeProvider` — the same wrapper Storybook's preview decorator uses,
so the generated HTML and Storybook stay identical. The Lody mark (icon + "Lody Review"
title) is baked into `ReviewRenderer`'s sidebar, not passed in.
