/**
 * Bumped when THIS tab's user approves leaving plan mode from a permission
 * card, so the session view can drop plan mode from its composer selector.
 *
 * A counter rather than a flag: a session can plan, implement, and plan again,
 * and each approval must be observable. Two permission surfaces raise it (the
 * floating card and the inline one in the transcript) and the composer that
 * owns the mode selection state is far from both, so an atom beats threading a
 * callback through the virtualized message list.
 *
 * Local to the tab on purpose — the run-config selection it drives is local
 * too. Do not replace this with a doc/history-derived signal: a teammate's
 * approval, or an old approval arriving as the session doc syncs, would then
 * unset plan mode for a user who had just chosen it.
