/**
 * Keeps the focused control inside a scroll container visible above the native
 * soft keyboard.
 *
 * On iOS Capacitor the WebView is NOT resized when the keyboard opens
 * (`resize: "none"` + `interactive-widget=overlaps-content`), so the browser's
 * default focus-scroll can leave the focused input — or the controls just below
 * it — hidden behind the keyboard. Sheets lift themselves via
 * `bottom-[var(--native-keyboard-height)]` and cap their scroll height to the
 * visible region; this hook then pulls the focused element to the CENTER of
 * that region. Centering (rather than `nearest`/`end`) is deliberate: it leaves
 * room below the focused field so a trailing cluster (e.g. the new-chat agent +
 * permission row that sits under the composer) also clears the keyboard.
 *
 * Fires on:
 *   - `lody:keyboard-resize` with height > 0 (keyboard opening), and
 *   - focus moving between fields while the keyboard is already up.
 *
 * Web is a no-op because the native shell does not dispatch this event there.
 * Android keeps `--native-keyboard-height` at `0px` because the WebView resizes, but
 * the native shell still dispatches `lody:keyboard-resize`; this hook may recenter
 * after that resize.
 *
 * Listeners are bound to `window` / `document` (not the container) and read
 * `containerRef.current` lazily at event time, so the hook works even when the
 * container mounts later (e.g. a drawer that only renders its content when open).

 *
 * All of it is inert on web and Android, where the WebView resizes itself and
 * `--native-keyboard-height` stays `0px`; iOS Capacitor is where it matters.
 *
 * The lift is deliberately NOT transitioned: the sheet's height is driven by
 * `scrollStyle`'s `maxHeight`, which reacts to the keyboard var instantly, so
 * animating `bottom` would drop the sheet's top for a frame and slide it back.
