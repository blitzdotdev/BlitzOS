/**
 * iOS-style swipe-to-reveal-actions wrapper for a list row.
 *
 * Two variants:
 *  - `active` (default): left-swipe exposes a pin / unpin chip on the
 *    left and an archive chip on the right. Continuing past
 *    `AUTO_ARCHIVE_AT` grows the archive chip and releasing there fires
 *    `onArchive` immediately (no second tap), mirroring iOS Mail's
 *    super-swipe.
 *  - `archived`: left-swipe exposes a restore chip on the left and a
 *    delete chip on the right. No super-swipe — permanent delete is
 *    irreversible, so it always goes through the caller's confirmation
 *    (the chip just fires `onDelete`), never an accidental long-drag.
 *
 * Konsta doesn't ship a swipe-action primitive — this is custom but
 * tries to feel native:
 *  - Drag tracks the finger 1:1 (no rubber-banding on the negative
 *    direction; rightward drag past the snap-closed position is
 *    clamped so the row never reveals on the wrong side).
 *  - Spring snap-back / snap-open on release.
 *  - Tap-through preserved: when the user just taps the row (no
 *    horizontal movement) `useDrag`'s `filterTaps` lets the row's
 *    own onClick fire.
 *  - Vertical scrolling lives separately: we set `touchAction:
 *    pan-y` so swipes that have a vertical component pass through
 *    to the scroll container.
