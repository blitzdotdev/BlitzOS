/**
 * The single invisible left-edge strip a full-screen Vaul `direction="right"`
 * drawer is allowed to start its drag-to-dismiss from — giving the native iOS
 * edge-pop: as soon as the swipe begins the panel follows the finger and the
 * layer beneath is revealed, committing or snapping back on release.
 *
 * WHY a bare strip instead of a gesture handler: vaul drags a right drawer on
 * *any* pointerdown unless the target has a `data-vaul-no-drag` ancestor (see
 * vaul's `shouldDrag`). So the drawer's content is wrapped in
 * `data-vaul-no-drag` (see `VaulDrawerBody`) and this bare, *unmarked* div is
 * mounted on top of it. A swipe that starts here gets vaul's full interactive
 * drag; a center pan lands on the no-drag content and just scrolls/pans (so
 * horizontally-scrollable code blocks, wide tables, and the no-drag-portaled
 * zoomed image viewer never fight dismissal). There is no handler here — vaul
 * owns the gesture, the animation, and the commit/snap-back. `touch-action:
 * pan-y` lets a vertical swipe through the strip scroll the content beneath
 * while a horizontal swipe drives the drag. `z-30` keeps it above content but
 * below overlays (sheets, the image viewer).
 *
 * Most callers want `VaulDrawerBody` (strip + no-drag wrapper together); this is
 * exported on its own for the story, which injects `isNativeApp`.

 *
 * `topInset` is the chrome height above the body (header, or header + tab bar)
 * so the strip never overlaps a back button. Native-only behaviour lives in
 * `VaulDrawerEdgeBackZone`: on web no strip is mounted (browser / route history
 * owns back) but the content stays `data-vaul-no-drag`, so there is no web
