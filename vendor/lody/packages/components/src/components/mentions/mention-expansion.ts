/**
 * The single before-send transform for every mention type.
 *
 * Two things come out of it, from one pass:
 *
 * - the text the agent receives, with `$skill`, `@session:`, and pasted-text
 *   placeholders swapped for their machine-readable forms
 * - the spans saying which region of that text each mention became, so the
 *   transcript can paint the user's own wording back over it
 *
 * Every contributor describes its edits against the *original composer text*
 * and they are applied together. That is what removes the ordering coupling the
 * send paths used to have — restore-paste, then expand-skills, then
 * expand-sessions, each re-reading a string the previous one had already
 * resized. Now nothing depends on who runs first.
 *
 * Composed in one place on purpose: there are exactly two send paths (chat
 * landing and the session composer), and before this hook each of them wired
 * every expandable type by hand, so adding one meant editing both.
